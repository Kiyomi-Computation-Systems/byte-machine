# Proof that the Scheme harness's self-tests are not vacuous.
#
# The harness is the instrument every later milestone is measured with. If
# `check-equal` silently always returned true, the whole project would go green
# and stay green, and no test written with `check-equal` could notice. So each
# decision in the runner is broken in turn on a staged copy, and the self-tests
# must fail.
#
# FOUR PASSES, BECAUSE FOUR DIFFERENT WITNESSES ARE NEEDED
#
# Pass 1 runs the Chez self-tests lane against the shared runner body. That body
# is identical text on both runtimes, so verifying it on a second runtime would
# re-prove the same mutation at double the cost.
#
# Pass 2 runs the Gambit self-tests lane, for the one thing that is per-runtime
# by definition: an adapter's export list. A Chez lane cannot notice a name
# missing from the Gambit library.
#
# Pass 3 runs the Chez empty-selection lane through the exact-status helper, for
# the one decision in the runner that no in-process assertion can reach --
# harness-begin reading BYTE_MACHINE_TEST_FILTER out of the environment. A suite
# cannot set its own environment from inside the portable subset, and the
# harness exports no reader for the filter that read produces, so the only
# witness is a whole process that was supposed to select nothing and exit 2.
#
# Pass 4 runs the Chez bootstrap lane, for the defect that disarms the
# self-tests as it commits them: a failure counter that stops counting. Every
# assertion in every suite reports through the counter, so with it broken a
# failing suite prints its FAIL lines and still exits 0. The bootstrap counts
# its own failures with raw conditionals and exits by hand, which is exactly why
# it exists and why it is the only lane whose verdict survives.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE NEEDS FROM ITS ENVIRONMENT
#
# The self-tests assert that the lane declared its execution mode and that the
# registration's test name is visible, so BYTE_MACHINE_EXECUTION_MODE=source and
# BYTE_MACHINE_TEST_NAME must be set in this process; CTest supplies both. Run
# by hand without them, the baseline fails before any mutation is tried -- which
# is the designed behaviour, not a bug: an unverifiable baseline makes every
# mutation look caught.
